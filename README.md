 Task 2 – Predictive Analysis using Machine Learning

 
 
📘 Overview


This task focuses on applying machine learning techniques to build a predictive model that estimates outcomes based on a dataset. Using the BigBasket Products dataset, a regression model was developed to predict the Sale Price of a product from its Market Price and related attributes.
The goal of this task is to demonstrate key concepts in predictive analytics, including feature selection, model training, evaluation, and performance interpretation.

🎯 Objectives



To implement a machine learning regression model using real-world data.


To understand the relationship between market price and sale price.


To evaluate model performance using statistical metrics.


🧠 Key Steps Performed




Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values and selecting relevant features.


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding price distribution and correlation.


Model Development: Linear Regression model built using Scikit-Learn.


Model Evaluation: Calculated Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score to measure accuracy.


Visualization: Plotted relationships and compared actual vs predicted prices.


💡 Insights




A strong positive correlation exists between Market Price and Sale Price.


The regression model effectively predicts sale prices within an acceptable error range.


The analysis showcases how machine learning can support pricing strategies and business insights.
